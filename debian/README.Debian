OpenStack OCCI Interface
------------------------

There is a set of pipeline examples available at the following directory:

    /usr/share/doc/python-ooi/examples

You should append one of those to your OpenStack Compute (nova) pipeline,
that is usually "/etc/nova/api-paste.ini"

Then you can enable it by adding "ooi" to the "enabled_apis" option of your 
nova configuration file (usually "/etc/nova/nova.conf").
